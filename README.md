# NFL-Playoff-Fantasy-Football
Webscraping, Regex, and Pandas skills mobilized to efficiently compile and manipulate NFL Playoff scoring data for family and friends' Playoff Fantasy Football Pool

# DESCRIPTION

This project's purpose was to automate scoring calculations and assignments for my family's Fantasy Football Pool for the 2020 NFL Playoffs.

To do that, I webscraped ESPN's scoring summaries of each playoff game to calculate fantasy scores for each player in those games. (see the function get_single_game_points(input_url))

This script also combines all players and points on a (fantasy) roster into 1 dataFrame so we can see which of our participants is leading at any given point in the playoffs.

Ultimately, this notebook exports the tables it creates to Excel (in order to share the information in a familiar and legible format)

# REPRODUCTION

This project was written and run in python in a Jupyter Notebook. If you'd like to run the code, it is suggested that you import the code into a Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab) python enviornment of your own.






###### TODO

- Break down what's in each folder & what I built, by year
