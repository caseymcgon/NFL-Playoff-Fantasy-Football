# NFL-Playoff-Fantasy-Football
Webscraping, Regex, and Pandas skills mobilized to efficiently compile and manipulate NFL Playoff scoring data for family and friends' Playoff Fantasy Football Pool

#DESCRIPTION
This project's purpose was to automate scoring calculations and assignments for my family's Fantasy Football Pool for the 2020 NFL Playoffs.

To do that, I webscraped ESPN's scoring summaries of each playoff game to calculate fantasy scores for each player in those games. (see the function get_single_game_points(input_url))

Ultimately, this notebook exports the tables it creates to Excel (in order to share the information in a familiar and legible format)


This project was written and run in python in a Jupyter Notebook. If you'd like to run the code, it is suggested that you import the code into a Jupyter Notebook of your own.
