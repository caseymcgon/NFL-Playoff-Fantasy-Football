##### Roster Makeup
- 2 Quarterbacks
- 2 Kickers
- 2 Defenses
- 7 Position Players (RBs, WRs, TEs)

    - 1st Tiebreaker: Super Bowl Champion 
    - 2nd Tiebreaker: Super Bowl Runner-Up
    - 3rd Tiebreaker: Super Bowl Total Points


The roster you input before the first week will be your roster throughout the playoffs. 
In other words, when a player's team loses, they become a 'dead' spot in your roster in all following weeks.

Players may not be replaced or swapped, unless they are injured seriously enough to be placed on IR. In that case, they may be replaced with a player from the same NFL team the following week.

##### Scoring
- **TD** = 5 + 1 for every 10 yards
    - Ex: 47yd TD = 9 pts
- **FG** = 1 for every 10 yards, + 1 for every yard over 55
    - Ex: 47yd FG = 4 pts; 57yd FG = 7 pts
- **PAT** = 1
- **2-point PAT** = 2
- **Safety** = 2 (for defense)
- All returns for a TD, including INTs, fumbles, KOs, and punts, count as Defense TDs.  
- These TDs and safeties are the only way for defenses to score.
