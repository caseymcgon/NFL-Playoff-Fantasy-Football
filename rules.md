##### ðŸ“‹ Roster Makeup
- 2 Quarterbacks
- 2 Kickers
- 2 Defenses

The roster you input before the first week will be your roster throughout the playoffs. 
In other words, when a player's team loses, they become a 'dead' spot in your roster in all following weeks.

Players may only be replacd if their team wins and they are injured seriously enough to be placed on IR. In that case, they may be replaced with a player from the same NFL team the following week. Please reach out to Casey, John, or Kelly directly to instigate a replacement for an IR'd player before the first game the following weekend.

##### ðŸ§® Scoring
- **TD** = 5 + 1 for every 10 yards
    - Ex: 7yd TD = 5 pts; 47yd TD = 9 pts; 50yd TD = 10 pts
- **FG** = 1 for every 10 yards, + 1 for every 2 yards over 55
    - Ex: 47yd FG = 4 pts; 56yd FG = 5 pts; 57yd FG = 6 pts
- **PAT** = 1
- **2-point PAT** = 2
- **Safety** = 2 (for defense)
- All returns for a TD, including INTs, fumbles, KOs, and punts, count as Defense TDs.
